                            alt="Ensemble Sheikhantaur" class="alignleft">
                    </p>
                    <p>The territory of the Sheikhantaur ensemble is located between Abdulla Qadiri and Alisher Navoi
                        streets. The ensemble consists of three mausoleums: the mausoleum of Sheikh Khovendi At-Takhur,
                        the mausoleum of Kaldyrgach-biy and the mausoleum of Yunus-Khan.
                    </p>
                    <p>Sheikhantaur was born at the end of the 13th century into a Khodja family in the mountain village
                        of Bogustan (now there is the Charvak reservoir). His father, Sheikh Omar, was a descendant of
                        the second righteous caliph, Omar. The people believed that Sheikh Omar knew how to work
                        miracles and command the elements. The highest grace seemed to have passed to the son. Young
                        Sheikhantaur learned Sufi truths. According to biographers, the Tashkent Sufi was particularly
                        struck then by the truth: <strong>"High spiritual qualities and knowledge in the sciences are
                            directly proportional to the patience and meekness of a sage in relation to the rudeness of
                            the ignorant."</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Sheikh lived and preached in Tashkent and died between 1355-1360. According to legend, the
                        mausoleum over his grave was built on the initiative of Amir Temur himself. This is a
                        two-chambered low structure under two domes of different heights.
                    </p>
                    <p>The building acquired its present appearance after numerous restorations and alterations at the
                        beginning of the 19th century. There are three gravestones inside, one under a large dome and
                        two under a small one. The only one of 48 saurs (planted by Alexander the Great), Iskander's
                        saur, has been preserved in the mausoleum. The petrified coniferous tree is located inside the
                        mausoleum right next to the majestic tombstone of the Sheikh.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is worth noting that many outstanding Tashkent residents belonged to the Sheikhantaura clan,
                        including the famous Timurid preacher Ubaidulla Khoja Akhror (1404-1490) and the independent
                        ruler of Tashkent in the second half of the 18th century, Yunus-Hajj.
                    </p>
                    <p>Another mausoleum, Mazar Kaldyrgach-biya, has survived to this day near the Sheikhantaur
                        mausoleum. With the characteristic shape of the pyramidal dome, this architectural monument of
                        the 15th century differs sharply from other buildings of the complex and resembles the mazars of
                        the Kazakh steppes. Indeed, under the arches of this mausoleum lies the ashes of the famous
                        statesman Tole-biy (Kazakh by birth). Together with the people of Tashkent, Tole-biy managed to
                        expel the Dzhangar-Kalmyk invader from the land of Central Asia. Tole-biy appointed Yunus-haja,
                        the Sheikhantaur khokim, who became the independent ruler of the Tashkent state, as his
                        confidant in Tashkent.
                    </p>
                    <p>Another surviving mausoleum of the complex of the late 15th century is the mausoleum of Yunus
                        Khan, the grandfather of the great Babur. The building has been restored many times. This is a
                        rare type of khanaka (Sufi monastery), T-shaped with a high revak along the top of the facade.

                    </p>
                    <p>Suzuk-ota, who received the name Mustafokul from birth, was born in 1140 in Turkestan in the
                        village of Korachuk. He was the youngest son of the only daughter of Ahmad Yassawi. Grandfather,
                        rocking his little grandson on his knees, often said: "My dear, beloved (suzugim), welcome!", So
                        those around him began to call the boy Suzuk.
                    </p>
                    <p>This man became famous in the entire district of the city and even beyond its borders for his
                        talents, ability to unite people, beneficent deeds, which caused great respect among local
                        residents.
                    </p>
                    <p>Upon reaching adulthood, he settled in a deserted, hilly and abandoned area and began to improve
                        it. Having invited Koran readers, craftsmen, relatives and friends from his small homeland, he
                        built houses, gave everyone shelter, introduced science and craft to the broad masses. He also
                        trained young people in agriculture, handicrafts and other professions. Suzuk-ota was the mentor
                        of hundreds of craftsmen and artisans. The respected mentor died in 1217. And his mahalla became
                        famous as a "mahalla of masters."
                    </p>
                    <p>The complex, built in 1392 during the reign of Amir Temur, consists of a mosque and a mausoleum.
                        In 2019, a major reconstruction of this religious building took place. The mausoleum and the
                        mosque have been reconstructed, an area of almost 8 hectares has been landscaped. One of the
                        buildings of the complex houses a museum, a library and a gathering of citizens. On both sides
                        of the complex there are 30 two-storey cottages for artisans. Workshops and shops will be opened
                        on the ground floor of the cottages.

                        in 1966. The complex was built near the burial place of the first Tashkent imam – Kaffal
                        ash-Shashi, who was a scientist and religious figure.

                        religious complex.
                    </p>
                    <p>The building of the madrasah dates back to the 16th century. Subsequently, it was rebuilt several
                        times. Once there was a hospitable house of dervishes, and in 1857 the first library was
                        created, which later turned into one of the richest book collections in the Islamic world.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2008, next to the building of the madrasah, a new library building was built and part of the
                        book fund was transferred to specially designated premises. These are 20 thousand books. Among
                        them: about 3 thousand manuscripts, 10 thousand lithographs, unique samples of calligraphy and
                        translations of the Koran in more than 30 languages.

                        Quran weighs about 35 kilograms and is 353 pages long. Over the long centuries of its history,
                        it has experienced many trials: for centuries it was kept in the treasuries of the caliphs of

                        square. This madrasah has long become a symbol of the old part of the capital. In the 10th
                        century, one of the three city gates was located here.
                    </p>
                    <p>The madrasah was built in the 16th century. during the reign of the Sheibanids. The construction
                        was supervised by the chief vizier, nicknamed "kukaldosh", translated from the Turkic "milk
                        brother" (hence the unusual name of madrasah.). He was close to the Tashkent rulers Barak Khan
                        and Dervish Khan.
                    </p>
                    <p>Many legends are associated with the activity of the madrasah. Long-livers of the region say that
                        earlier public executions were carried out on the territory of the madrasah. Unfaithful wives
                        were thrown from the highest minaret in order to teach a lesson and shame the local population.
                        According to another legend, a spreading pistachio tree once grew here, it was considered
                        sacred, as it grew on one of the domes of the madrasah.
                    </p>
                    <p>On one of the inner walls of the madrasah there is an inscription: "Death is inevitable, but the
                        work done by a person remains forever."
                    </p>
                    <p>Today the Kukeldash madrasah is one of the largest architectural monuments of the capital. The
                        high-rise building of baked bricks was built on the principle of Muslim spiritual institutions:
                        a large courtyard surrounded by prayer rooms and study rooms. The facade is represented by an
                        entrance portal (peshtak) with a height of almost 20 m. There are also two-tier carved balconies
                        with traditional corner towers. On the windows of the building, sun-protection bars are used,
                        where an engraving is visible using the name of Allah and his Prophet Muhammad, sacred to any
                        believer.

                    <p>Throughout the history of its existence, the building of the madrasah has witnessed many events.
                        It was destroyed several times. It once housed a caravanserai. In the XIX century. this building
                        served as the residence of the Kokand khans. From here, the Tashkent rebels were fired from
                        cannons.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Kukeldash madrasah was completely restored by the efforts of the Tashkent masters and the
                        status of a spiritual institution was returned to it. Here and today you can hear the voices of
                        muezzins calling Muslims to prayer, various religious services are performed, and classes for
                        students are held in classrooms (hujras).

                    </p>
                    <p>In the center of the city, in the Yunusabad region, there is an ancient archeological monument -
                        the ruins of the Aktepa settlement.
                    </p>
                    <p>Such a small hill seems unusual and wildly attractive. This is not just a hill, but a unique
                        fortified manor of a large palace of the pre-Arab period. Presumably it was the summer residence
                        of Tudun Chach. Several generations of Turkic governors, who were subordinate to the rulers of
                        the Chach state, lived in this palace. According to excavations, the castle was built in the 5th
                        century. AD on a hill, using an ancient platform made of raw bricks (pakhsy).
                    </p>
                    <p>The total area of the archaeological site was about 100 hectares. In the southern part of the
                        settlement, there are the ruins of a fortress castle (keshka) in the form of a high hill with
                        steep slopes 22-28 m high, to which an unfortified settlement adjoined.
                    </p>
                    <p>The palace, 86x180 m in size, is oriented approximately from north to south and is separated from
                        the village by a ravine of considerable depth, which served as a moat. It consisted of a
                        two-story building with a wide staircase. The first floor had dimensions of 80x80 m, the second
                        floor – 50x50 m.On the inside, both floors were encircled by a long gallery corridor 2 m wide
                        and 2.3 m high.At the corners of the upper corridor there were round domed towers with rooms.
                        The interior of the building consisted of long, narrow rooms with domed roofs that were
                        connected by a system of corridors.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the first quarter of the 7th century, the estate was rebuilt. The narrow premises were covered
                        with earth, thereby turning the building into a solid pedestal, on which new buildings were
                        erected. Four corner towers were fortified, and a 22x22 m castle was erected in the southwestern
                        part of the estate. It had the shape of a multi-tiered pyramid with a donjon tower and had four
                        defensive tiers. Judging by the preserved part of the building, it was also two-story. Its lower
                        floor was occupied by arched rooms, and the owner lived on the upper floor.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the northern part of the palace, 10 rooms were discovered that formed the temple complex.
                        Religious buildings were gradually formed around the domed mausoleum. Adjacent to it was a
                        two-room sanctuary, in one of the rooms of which there was an altar of fire, and the other
                        served as a ceremonial hall. Memorial sacrifices were performed in separate rooms and the priest
                        lived.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the eastern part of the fortress there were 9 elongated two-storey buildings of the utility
                        part. The first floor mainly served as storage rooms where food supplies were stored. The second
                        floor served as the dwelling of the servants and the garrison of the guards. In addition, a
                        separate room in the backyard was occupied by a wine press.
                    </p>
                    <p>There were no fences or signs around the ruins before. Absolutely everyone could go there. Over
                        the past few years, it was fenced off, and an information board was hung near the entrance.

                    <p>On one of the central streets there is a unique hill called Ming Urik (Thousand Apricots).
                    </p>
                    <p>This hill is the ruins of an ancient fortress that guarded the capital of the Turkic Kaganate
                        Chach. According to archaeological research, the city existed at the beginning of the 1st
                        century. AD before the arrival of the Arabs in Central Asia. As scientists assume, the complex
                        served as an ancient residence of the Turkic rulers. The layout of the premises and buildings
                        indicates that ancient pagan temples were located here, with open altars for fire.
                    </p>
                    <p>The capital city of the ancient kaganate existed until the 4th century. AD According to Chinese
                        sources, the territory of modern Tashkent was part of the state of Kangyui. After the collapse
                        of the Kangyui state, this region at the beginning of the 4th century turned into an independent
                        state.
                    </p>
                    <p>The unique settlements Ming Urik, Kanka, Shashtepa are vivid evidence of how the historical
                        urbanization of this territory took place. Today, the Ming Urik settlement and the museum
                        located on its territory are under state protection and are objects of study of the history of
                        Tashkent.<br>
